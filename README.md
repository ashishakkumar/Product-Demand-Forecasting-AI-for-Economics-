# Product-Demand-Forecasting-AI-for-Economics-

Hi everyone! 

In this Project for the subject AI for Economics, we have made an application interface that can help us forecast : 
1. Total units that can be demanded at various stores
2. Total SKUs that can be demande
both are predicted on a weekly basis

We tried Multiple models like :
1. Linear Regression
2. Polynomial Regression
3. Decision Tree Regressor
4. Random Forest Regressor
5. XGBOOST Regressor
6. LSTM

Among all the models, Random Forest Regressor performed the best.
